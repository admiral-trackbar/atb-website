    ##### The Tank Treads
    <br />The main body of the robot utilized a tank-like tread design. The main idea was that if the treads were long enough, we could drive over the first gap, as well as the second, and we would not need a bridge mechanism of any sort. The treads themselves were 3D printed using flexible TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane) filament. We had two iterations of the treads. The first iteration used an inverted timing belt design, which did not mesh well with any timing pulley design that we could create. The second belt design looked more like a regular timing belt, and meshed well with the laser-cut pulleys we created.

    <br /> Here are images of the first and second belt designs respectively.

    <br /> We used cardboard in the begining to visualize the maximum size of our robot, and to see where we sould place the axels. This basis prototyping was enough to show us that the treads would loos alignment with the wheels.

    <br /> The second treaded design worked much better. Above is a side view of the treads on the robot. Nothing else had been mounted yet at this point.

    <br />In order to attach the belts to the base of the robot, we created several aluminum axles. These axles had to be precisely cut using a lathe (tolerance +- 0.05mm) in order to accurately fit several bearings.

    <br />The pulleys of the tracks were laser cut out of acrylic. We made one set of pulleys adjustable so that we could apply tension to the belt. However, that was not enough to stop the treads from sagging when we crossed the gaps, so we decided to add bogey pullies for more support. Each pulley was attached via bearing to the aluminum shafts, which resulted in a really low-friction system. Lastly, each tank tread was powered with a brushed DC motor. The motors were attached to a driving pulley via a large gear reduction to give us plenty of torque.

    <br />To test what the limits of the tread system were, we temporarilly attached a remote controll and drove the robot aroun. Here is a video of the tread system in action.
