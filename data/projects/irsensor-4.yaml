    In order to accurately determine the position the robot on the competition surface as well as the relative position of the ewoks to the robot, we built an IR sensor array, which provided us easy access to 8 distance measurements up to 30cm away. In order to acheive this accuracy, we needed to calibrate each of the sensors. Below is an picture of the setup that we used for the calibration.

    <br />Above is a chart made from the calibration data. This data gave us the information we needed to convert a voltage to a distance for every phototransistor and IR LED pair, for each of the IR arrays.

    <br />The array consists of an I2C analog to digital converter IC, eight IR LEDs, eight IR phototransistors, and some additional circuitry to make the ADC function.

    <br /> Now you can see how the IR arrays came to be, from the design of the PCBs, to the actuall PCBs themselves, and then finally the populated PCBs.

    <br>The array utilized dual JST connectors, and could be daisy-chained (linked in series), so that the final installation used as little wire as possible. The schematic and PCB layout of the array was created in KiCad. The production of the PCB was outsourced to ALLPCB, then assembled by our team. <br>
