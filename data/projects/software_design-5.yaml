    In summary the logic broken down into 4 sections: First Ewok Pick Up, Second Ewok Pick Up, Archway Crossing, Third Ewok Pick Up, and Returning Home.

    ### First Ewok Pick Up

    Admiral Trackbar line follows until its QSD sensor in its left claw detects the first Ewok.

    In addition, it starts off with its left claw down and its right claw up. 

    ### Second Ewok Pick Up

    After picking up the first Ewok, Admiral Trackbar adjusts its position properly before crossing the first gap. Then, just like picking up the first Ewok, Admiral Trackbar uses its QSD sensor in its left claw to detect the second Ewok.

    Similar to picking up the first Ewok, Admiral Trackbar also has its left claw down and its right claw up when picking up the second Ewok.

    ### Archway Crossing

    To cross the archway safely, we maximize the amount of time for Admiral Trackbar to cross the archway by first detecting a 10 kHz signal from our IR Beacon, then waiting for a 1 kHz signal, and finally crossing the archway once the IR signal switches back to 10 kHz.

    Moreover, to cross the archway, we need to have both arms up.

    ### Third Ewok Pick Up

    Firstly, to not mix up the third Ewok with a Stormtrooper, we lowered Admiral Trackbar's left claw, while keeping its right claw up, after it first detects the front edge of the competition platform. Then, we have Admiral Trackbar to move backwards and pick up the third Ewok.

    ### Returning Home

    In summary, we have Admiral Trackbar reverse its position and line follow back to Start.
